            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>In a large bowl, combine 2 cups of regular rice and 1 cup of urad dal (split black lentils) with ½
                teaspoon
                fenugreek seeds. Rinse them well and soak in water separately for 4-6 hours. After soaking, drain the
                water
                from the rice and dal. Grind them separately to a smooth consistency using a blender or a wet grinder,
                adding water gradually as needed. Mix the ground rice and dal together in a bowl, add salt to taste, and
                whisk the batter thoroughly. The consistency should be similar to pancake batter. Allow the batter to
                ferment overnight or for at least 8 hours, covering the bowl with a lid.</p>
            <p>Heat a non-stick or cast-iron griddle (tawa) over medium heat. Once hot, sprinkle a few drops of water on
                the
                tawa – if it sizzles, the tawa is ready. Pour a ladleful of dosa batter onto the center of the tawa and
                quickly spread it outward in a circular motion to form a thin, round dosa. Drizzle a little oil or ghee
                around the edges of the dosa and a few drops on the top. Cook until the bottom turns golden brown and
                crispy, then flip it over using a spatula. Cook the other side for a minute or so until it turns light
                golden. Remove the dosa from the tawa and serve hot with sambar, coconut chutney, or any desired
                accompaniments.</p>

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>To make pasta, start by bringing a pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta of your choice and cook
                it
                according to the package instructions until it is al dente, which means it is cooked but still firm to
                the
                bite. While the pasta is cooking, prepare the sauce of your preference, such as marinara, Alfredo, or
                pesto,
                by saut√©ing ingredients like garlic, onions, and herbs, and then adding tomatoes, cream, or other
                desired
                components. Once the pasta is cooked, drain it in a colander, reserving some pasta water if needed for
                the
                sauce. Combine the cooked pasta and the sauce in a pan or serving dish, tossing them together to coat
                the
                pasta evenly. Serve the pasta hot, optionally garnished with grated cheese, fresh herbs, or a drizzle of
                olive oil. Enjoy your delicious homemade pasta!</p>
